# clock_drifts
Evaluation of seismological station clock drifts errors.
This approach is based on the analysis of differential P- & S-wave arrival times, and is particularly adapted to datasets composed of earthquake clusters.
Input data consists of: 
- differential P and S arrival times for each pair of earthquakes located in the same cluster, and
- a constant Vp/Vs value, which should hold for the overall cluster area.
